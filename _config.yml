  Hi there! My name is Ben. I am a recent B.S. Computer Science grad from the University of Michigan, and I have recently 
  begun a full-time role with AT&T Chicago as a Technology Development Program Engineer. My experience spans everywhere from
  writing fullstack web and mobile apps in React, NodeJS, Swift, and Python, to creating scheduled microservices in Java/Apache Camel
  that are used to consume large datasets for machine learning (my current role).

  Outside of coding, I enjoy exercising, reading, cooking and writing and recording music.

          - Contributed over 600+ lines of NodeJS code to a local development tool used by several developers 
          for "Handlebars" template syntax validation and streamlined a loading process that would ordinarily 
          take hours over the course of a single day, yielding hours of saved development/labor costs and efficiency. 
          Introduced an additional 300+ lines of code in unit testing to ensure code quality.
          - Spearheaded the creation of a new Java/Maven/Apache Camel microservice totaling over 3000+ lines of code 
          that would be used for directing terabytes worth of data over the course of its lifetime to inform customer 
          segment marketing for att.com. Incorporated an additional 1200+ lines of unit testing code, and performed 
          stress-testing to ensure stability under various data loads.

          - Contributed 500+ lines of code to "Device Tracker", a React/Node.js application that would be used to 
          locate 1000+ misplaced Android devices across hundreds of Home Depot retail locations, yielding hundreds
           of thousands of dollars in savings in labor and replacement costs
          - Initiated the development "App360", a React/Node.js/MongoDB application that aimed to consolidate data 
          on hundreds of Home Depot software applications, allowing directors, managers, and associates to communicate
           more effectively across teams and reduce redundancy in overlapping projects

          During my final semester at the University of Michigan, 3 peers and I designed and implemented a crowd-sourced Swift/Firebase iOS application for 
          "EECS 497: Human-Centered Software Design and Development" that was used to map out various accessibility features intended for disabled individuals
          found among local businesses, landmarks, and other public areas. We utilized Google Maps/Places API, as well as Google/Facebook APIs for authentication.

          During the 2019-2020 school year, I lead a team of 15 Michigan Hacker iOS team members in the planning, designing, and implementation of a gamified iOS 
          application centered around discretely taking photos of opponents in elimination-style rounds. We utilized Swift, UIKit, Firebase, and Facebook/Google 
          APIs for authentication

          During my time at the University of Michigan, I gained extensive experience solving complex problems found both within and outside of the classroom. 
          Through my coursework I have gained experience working with a variety of programming languages, including C++, JavaScript, Python, Rust and OCaml. 
          My coursework has also introduced me to a number of fundamental concepts found in software engineering, including object-oriented programming, 
          test-driven development, version control, and many other topics.

          In addition to my coursework, I was heavily involved with "Michigan Hackers", a computer science student organization that seeks to foster a community 
          of students and individuals who are passionate about technology and who are eager to build many relevant technical and social skills not commonly taught
          inside the classroom. During my time with organization, I served as the Project Manager for the iOS core team and later as the President of the organization.
          My time with organization offered many valuable lessons in leadership, teamwork, and mentorship. I currently serve as a senior advisor for the organization.

      This is where you can write a little more about yourself. You could title this section **Interests** and include some of your other interests.

      Or you could title it **Skills** and write a bit more about things that make you more desirable, like *leadership* or *teamwork*
