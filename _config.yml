  Hi there! My name is Ben. I am a recent B.S. Computer Science grad from the University of Michigan,  
  and I have recently begun a full-time role with AT&T Chicago as a Technology Development Program Engineer.
  My experience spans everywhere from writing fullstack web and mobile apps in React, NodeJS, Swift, and Python, 
  to creating scheduled microservices in Java/Apache Camel that are used to consume large datasets for machine 
  learning (my current role).

          - Contributed over 600+ lines of NodeJS code to a local development tool used by several developers 
          for "Handlebars" template syntax validation and streamlined a loading process that would ordinarily 
          take hours over the course of a single day, yielding hours of saved development/labor costs and efficiency. 
          Introduced an additional 300+ lines of code in unit testing to ensure code quality.
          - Spearheaded the creation of a new Java/Maven/Apache Camel microservice totaling over 3000+ lines of code 
          that would be used for directing terabytes worth of data over the course of its lifetime to inform customer 
          segment marketing for att.com. Incorporated an additional 1200+ lines of unit testing code, and performed 
          stress-testing to ensure stability under various data loads.

      This is where you can write a little more about yourself. You could title this section **Interests** and include some of your other interests.
